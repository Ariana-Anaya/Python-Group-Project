step 2 : CSS Project Requirements
 
Ariana Anaya edited this page 3 weeks ago · 1 revision
CSS Requirements for App Academy Portfolio Projects First impressions are a HUGE deal when interviewing for a job or presenting your portfolio projects to potential employers.

A visually satisfying portfolio project will more likely catch and hold the attention of a potential employer than a portfolio project that lacks visual appeal regardless of functionality.

To keep future potential employers and interviewers interested in your portfolio project, you must make your portfolio project visually appealing, otherwise you risk being passed over in favor of other applicants.

You might be thinking, "I have time to make it visually appealing after I graduate from App Academy, so I don't need to worry about it now." This is far from correct. You will be very busy leading up to graduation and after graduation. Delaying the work on making your portfolio project visually appealing now will delay your job search significantly.

CSS styling is a big part of making a full-stack portfolio project visually appealing. You may find that the majority of time that you spend on the full-stack portfolio project is on CSS, and that is normal. CSS is the make-or-break factor of your portfolio project from a potential employer's perspective.

The rest of this document will outline what you should achieve to meet the minimum CSS requirements of your full-stack portfolio project.

CSS Specifications You must follow the design of the application you are cloning as close as possible, down to the colors. This is not a bootcamp for creating designers, and you are not training to be designers. The application that you are cloning is already designed and you must replicate and implement the design of the target cloned site through organizing your HTML elements and styling them through CSS.

TO DO CHECKLIST Important Note: You must finish the basic functionality of your feature before styling it.

✅ All links, buttons, input fields, and text features on the site are functioning properly and belong to the features that were worked on

✅ The alignment / justification of each element is consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The colors used on each element are comparable with the target cloned site or within professional standards

✅ The fonts & font sizes used on each element are comparable with the target cloned site

✅ Google FontsLinks to an external site. or the built-in browser fonts must be used for fonts

✅ Your site has no glaring visual issues on a standard size laptop (needs to be a desktop version of the target cloned site - 1024px)

✅ The logo and name of your application are different from the target cloned site

✅ Your document page title and application's favicon match that of the name and the logo of your application

✅ The white spacing (padding, margin, border, and positioning) of each element are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The box-shadows of each element are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The buttons are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The menus are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The mouse-pointers are consistent with industry standards

✅ The hover effects on each element are consistent with the target cloned site

✅ The icons used are comparable with the target cloned site

✅ FontAwesomeLinks to an external site. must be used for icons

You can use FlexBox

You can use Grid.css
